							I find my passion for tech in the front end, specifically in UI
							design and implementation. I have always tended toward more
							creative outlets that have a degree of skill and find coding to be
							the perfect mix for me. I love seeing how a page slowly comes
							together and tweaking those small details to make it extra
							special.
