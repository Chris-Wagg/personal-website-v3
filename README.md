The build of my personal website!

This project was a sort of culmination of everything that I have learnt in The odin project so far, along with some other things.

This project was built using React, vanilla Javascript (removed) and vanilla CSS.

Credit to https://brittanychiang.com/ for the inspiration for the website design and colour scheme. Aside from that all the code was written by me.

This app is deployed to firebase and linked t a custom domain, it acn be found at https://chriswagg.com
